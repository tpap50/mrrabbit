<h1> AFL umpires and goal umpires

<p> Roles of the field umpire
    The student umpire has a crucial role to play in AFL Sport Education. Students need to practise to become umpires.
    The role of the field umpire on match day is to:
    • Apply the rules and their interpretations according to the spirit of the laws.
    • Attend to the administrative requirements necessary for the successful staging of the game.
    General play
    Controlling the match is the major responsibility of the field umpires. While there are many factors that influence control, the way in which
    umpires go about their tasks is the most critical one.
    Tips for getting started
    A. Rules
    Ensure you understand the rules of the modified game being implemented as part of the AFL Sport Education program.
    B. Umpires are decision-makers.
    • Accordingly, they have to have the courage of their convictions to make decisions irrespective of where on the ground, or at what time of
    the match, the need to make a decision arises.
    • Pay the first free kick – do not allow scrimmages to go too long.
    C. Umpires need to demonstrate confidence in their decisions. Confidence is demonstrated by:
    • A strong, long whistle – BLOW it hard.
    • Verbal communication of the decision – eg. “Push in the back, your free kick No. 7” – being delivered in a strong, firm manner and voice.
    Project the voice with strength and firmness.
    • Visual indications being performed in the correct manner on every occasion – SHOW everybody why!
    • Then GO. Move promptly to take up position for the next act of play.
    Roles of the goal umpire
It is the very important responsibility of the goal umpire to:
• Be the sole judge of the score.
• Keep record of all the goals and behinds scored in the match.
• Confirm score with other goal umpire at half-time.
• Complete scorecard and submit to football committee member/match manager.
Judging the score
• In order for a score to be registered, the football must be completely over the behind or goal lines, or have hit the goal post.
A goal is scored:
• When the ball completely crosses the goal line after being kicked by a player on the attacking team without touching a player or
goal post.
A behind is scored:
• If the ball hits the goal post or travels over the goal post.
• Crosses the behind line.
• Is touched by a player.
• If the ball is taken over the goal or behind line by player.
• If the ball touches or passes over the behind post, then the ball is considered out of bounds.
How to complete a scorecard
Record progressively:
• Record the scores progressively, ie. 1 2 3, rather than 1 1 1.
Confer each quarter/half:
• At the end of each quarter/half, the goal umpires confer to check each has the same score.
• If the scores are not the same, the goal umpires discuss the situation during the break and try to resolve the matter.
Total at the end of the match:
• Add up the goals and behinds scored by each team at the end of the match, and record the total scores.
